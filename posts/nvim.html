                my brain hurts :(<br>
                (this entire post was written entirely within neovim!!)
            </p>

            <p>
                usually i use vscode as my main editor,, but then i saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jdh">jdh</a> use neovim and i thought,<br>
                "hey maybe i should try!"

            </p>

            <p>
                so i went on google, searched up "neovim", downloaded it, and then i was confused
            </p>

            <p>
                "how do i use this??"<br>
                "what does this mean??!??"<br>
                "what do i do"<br>
                "why does my installation look different than his??"<br>
                "how do i exit neovim?"
            </p>

            <p>
                i guess i wasn't patient enough, since i just closed it, left it on my laptop, and never ever tried using it again...<br>
                ...until now!!
            </p>

            <p>
                a lot of time has passed by since i first tried neovim and i finally, FINALLY decided to do it right this time.<br>
                i was still impatient, but i didn't need to worry!
            </p>

            <p>
                someone told me i can just install nvchad, which does literally EVERYTHING for me. nvim goes from vim to a code editor.
            </p>

            <p>
                after installing nvchad (and messing up the installation... we don't talk about that), setting things to ny liking, and more setting up, i could finally maybe start using neovim as my main code editor!!
            </p>

            <p>uhh if you want my (VERY BASIC) setup here you go!!</p>

            <li>nvchad (that installed other things that i am too lazy to list :3)</li>
            <li>gruvbox theme</li>
            <li>alacritty (terminal)</li>

            <p>i also got uhh alacritty, a terminal<br>while installing nvim, i was using cmd (windows terminal) and the padding was just a bit off?<br>
            i set it to zero and it was still off<br>
            so i got alacritty, which lets me customize the terminal a little more<br>
            i like configuring using .toml files. it's easier for me. idk why
            </p>

            <p>
                also a cool feature everytime the .toml changes alacritty applies those changes automatically without restarting, i thought that was cool
            </p>

            <p>neovim is going to take a while to get used to, but i think i can do it!! hopefully!!</p>

            <p><small>how do i debug this .html file within neovim..</small></p>

            <p>ok bye</p>
