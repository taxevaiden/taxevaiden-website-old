            <p>
                sorry for the uhh,, long wait for a new blog ig idk<br>it is 6:45 AM as i'm writing this
            </p>

            <p>on-topic though, i watched <a href="https://youtu.be/lobsylI97vY?si=cyYTa6HCF5MzIKWw">Velmi_r's playthrough</a> of the last <b>horror</b> entry in the catto boi series, <a href="https://mango-ki.itch.io/catto-boi-requiem">"Catto Boi - Requiem"</a> and GOD DAMN CATTO BOI HAS IMRPOVED SO MUCH</p>
            <p>incase you don't know what catto boi is, (how could you not <b>:rage:</b>) catto boi initially started as one of those games like sonic.exe<br>
            there was a lot of uhh..</p>

            <li>cheap jumpscares</li>
            <li>fourth wall breaks</li>
            <li>and a <b>LOT</b> of blood</li>

            <p>that's pretty much what was in the first game, "The Adventures of Catto Boi". <small>no not the new one the old one</small></p>
            <p>after that game, "Catto Boi's Bizarre Adventure" came, and was pretty much the same as the last game. (i barely remember,, sigh)</p>
            <p>more and more games came, and catto boi was slowly evolving. even having some actual lore!</p>
            <p>but then mango-ki, the creator of catto boi, decided to take all of those games down and started remaking them one by one<br>
            you could VERY much tell that they put a lot more effort and passion into these remakes.</p>

            <p>one of these remakes was "Catto Boi - Requiem". mango-ki cooked with this one</p>
            <p><small>i am still shocked at that ending dude WHAT</small></p>

            <h2>so what's the point of this blog??</h2>
            <p>i just really wanted to say,, thank you</p>
            <p>these games actually changed my life,<br>
            they introduced me to a new genre of horror in probably the best way possible LOL</p>
            <p>i honestly don't know where i would be now if i hadn't seen YuB (or zachbealetv i can't remember which one i watched first) playing catto boi.<br>
            it inspired me to do well, <b>all of this</b></p>
            <p>so thank you, for making these games even if they weren't that great. you inspired me to actually do stuff. /lh</p>
            <p><3</p>
            

            <p><small>why does the heart symbol look so,, off dude WHY<br>man i can't wait for "Catto Boi Forever"</small></p>

            <p>anyway, can someone give me $30.00 AUD (or about $20.00 USD) so i can buy all the catto boi games and have the catto mess with my computer ok thanks</p>
