            <p>
                it's offical; themes are now on the site<br><small>there was no need to be this dramatic about it but do i care? no</small>
            </p>

            <p>currently, there are only a few, but i might make a thing where you can make your own themes? probably won't be likely, since i still want this to be <b>my</b> website, but it's a cool idea to think about.</p>
            <p>i can also finally fill my desire to make a "terminal" theme for the website. i think it's one of my favorites.<br>oh yeah and i also made a theme for my friend. it's named "DurpyDoo" because that's pretty much his name.</p>
            <p>if you want to know why i made a theme for my friend, uhh the discord chat went something like this</p>

            <p>
                <b>taxevaiden</b>: i finally got some themes working.<br>
                <b>taxevaiden</b>: i wonder what other themes i should add,,<br>
                <b>DurpyDoo</b>: blue<br>
                <b>taxevaiden</b>: oo and then i can plaster your pfp all over the place<br>
                <b>DurpyDoo</b>: yes<br>
                <b>DurpyDoo</b>: you should also make the font Comic Sans<br>
                <b>taxevaiden</b>: ok man.
            </p>

            <p>so yeah that's why.</p>
            <p>anyway if you have like any more theme ideas you can just tell me idk<br>ok bye</p>
