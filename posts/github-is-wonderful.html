            <p>
                you heard that right,<br>something owned by microsoft is wonderful<br><small>vscode is also really good i'm literally using it as i'm typing this</small>
            </p>

            <p>i like being able to use my own code editor and publish the code to the world<br>this very website is being hosted using pages.dev (with github)<br><small>i did host this website with github pages at one point, but i didn't like the domain. taxevaiden.github.io?? no.</small></p>
            <p>back then, i was using other hosts, such as neocities.</p>
            <p>don't get me wrong, neocities is good, and they have a very creative community<br>but i just found it... limiting to me.<br>the comment box i used wasn't working when i was hosting my old website on neocities</p>
            <p>i also used to have status.cafe on my website, which didn't work either.</p>
            <p>yes, there are alternatives like nekoweb which has none of those limits, but apparently it has 500mb of space. i will upload files here that might be bigger than that</p>
            <p>so github pages was my next best thing!<br>and boy was it nice. it really was like "your own." no limits, and the storage limit is almost infinity.</p>
            <p>after a while, i switched to pages.dev, which still used github.<br>i'm pretty sure pages.dev is owned by cloudflare, or something along the lines of that<br>(i can't rememeber)</p><p>and now i have ddos protection. i think</p>
            <p>anyway, if you want to host your own website, and you don't care about the limits, go for neocities/nekoweb. they're very nice services and easy to use<br>if you want no limits at all, go for github pages.</p>
            
            <p><small>oh wow this is my first long post ever that's crazy</small></p>
